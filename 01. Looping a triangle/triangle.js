/*
Looping a triangle 
Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following triangle:

#
##
###
####
#####
######
#######

It may be useful to know that you can find the length of a string by writing .length after it.
 var abc = "abc" ; 
 console . log ( abc . length ); 
 // â†’ 3
